# Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper [Gated Graph Sequence Neural
Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05493.pdf). This implementation has been
designed to be *simple and easy to read*. Whenever possible I refer directly to
equations and sections from the paper so definitely read the paper. Hopefully
this repo can help in understanding GGNNs.
