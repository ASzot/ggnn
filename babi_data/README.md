## bAbI Data Processing

All of the code here is for preprocessing the data. The command has already
been run and all of the final preprocessed data is actually here in the repo.
Each of the "processed" folders is one of the 10 folds generated from the data.
The code used for preprocessing was borrowed from
[yujiali/ggnn](https://github.com/yujiali/ggnn/tree/master/babi/data).
